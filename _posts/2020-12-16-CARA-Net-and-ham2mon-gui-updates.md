title: CARA Net and ham2mon-gui Updates
---

Tonight Sam and I checked into the [CARA Net](http://n7ei.org)
([Audio](http://sdrock.0x26.net:8080/?freq=146.880&start=2020-12-15T19:00:00-08:00&end=2020-12-15T19:45:00-08:00))
while we were out driving around. Meanwhile, back at the home QTH, the SDR scanner was recording
the net...

Later tonight, I implemented a date-range feature for the ham2mon-gui scanner interface that
makes it easy to link to a specific frequency at a specific time. Now I can easily link to
the recorded audio from any net or scheduled event without any further intervention
(assuming the SDR remains up and stable!).

As always, I'm still trying to work out audio levels and get the output sounding as best as I
can. Definite room for improvement exists.
