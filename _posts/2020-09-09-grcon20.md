title: GNU Radio Conference 2020
---

Preregister for the [GNU Radio Conference 2020](https://www.gnuradio.org/grcon/grcon20/) to learn about
exciting developments in the software defined radio space.

I learned about it from [KB6NU's blog](https://www.kb6nu.com/gnu-radio-conference-grcon-goes-online-for-2020-main-talks-and-discussion-rooms-are-free/)
and registered straight away. Registration is required to attend.
