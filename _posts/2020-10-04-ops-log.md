Saturday Oct 3 - 4, we took a backpacking trip to Snowgrass Flats in the
Gifford Pinchot National Forest and I took the opportunity to test out [APRS
coverage](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=13&ts=1601683200&te=1601856000&call=a%2FKF7HVM-5)
in the area and chased a SOTA activator!

During this trip, I beaconed my position at 4 minute intervals while
I was carrying my pack hiking for about 15 miles total. Because of the
topography of the area and proximity of digipeaters, only 10 of
approximately 180 packets were gated to APRS-IS!

For APRS I was using a dedicated Baofeng UV-5R with 1/4 wave whip strapped to
the back of my pack, connected to my Pixel 2 APRSDroid via bluetooth [Mobilinkd
TNC2](http://www.mobilinkd.com/tnc2/).

For voice comms, I was mostly listening to 146.52Mhz on a Kenwood TH-K20a.

Both radios were used for 12 hours without having to swap any batteries.

Just west of Goat Lake (CN96gm) at 2020-10-04 13:20 PST, I made contact with
AE7RP activating Council Bluff,
[W7W/LC-030](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W7W/LC-030) (CN96eg) on
146.52Mhz. We were each on 5 watt HT making perfect contact over a distance of
18.6mi.

From this position I was also able to hear stations in Ridgefield, WA (78mi),
Longview, WA (74mi), and Astoria, OR (105mi)!
