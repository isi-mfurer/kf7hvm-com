Friday, October 9, we took a hike on S. Coldwater Trail, near Mt. St. Helens'
Johnston Ridge Observatory [[APRS Track]](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&ts=1602201600&te=1602288000&call=a%2FKF7HVM-5).

During this trip, I beaconed my position at 4 minute intervals while
walking for about 7 miles total, out and back. Because of the
topography of the area and proximity of digipeaters, only 3 of
approximately 75 packets were gated to APRS-IS!

Later that evening, I assembled a temporary 80m wire dipole and played around
with the Xiegu G90. More reports to come once I can get all of the requisite
cables and firmware updates, as well as a separate post for the permanent
antenna setup.
