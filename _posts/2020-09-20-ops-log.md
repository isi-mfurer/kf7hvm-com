Today the family took a trip up to Mt. Rainier National Park
[[APRS Track]](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=10&ts=1600473600&te=1600657200&call=a%2FKF7HVM-5).

During the entire day, I was beaconing position on APRS at 4 minute intervals.

While driving between Castle Rock and Packwood, my packets were not digipeated or igated
at all, so the track does not match the route taken (I-5 to US-12).
From the vehicle, I was putting out 25w (medium power) from a 1/4 wave side-mounted antenna.

After arriving at [Naches Peak Loop Trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Naches+Peak+Loop+Trailhead/@46.8684453,-121.5169598,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xea00c1d4528ab993!8m2!3d46.8719073!4d-121.5154148),
I switched to the Baofeng UV-5R with 1/4 wave whip connected to my Pixel 2 via bluetooth
[Mobilinkd TNC2](http://www.mobilinkd.com/tnc2/). Nearly all packets were digipeated from the trail!

On the way home, I activated some non-local repeaters and made some QSOs.

* 145.41 [WA7DOB - Crystal Mountain](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=53&ID=18070) from WA-123 near US-12
  * KJ7OTM
  * WB7DOB (owner)
  * This is a linked repeater system and it wasn't clear whether I was coming into 3 sisters or Crystal.
    Further analysis shows that I was keying up the Crystal frequency, although WB7DOB was suggesting
    otherwise. Perhaps the frequencies have changed?
* 146.74 [K7KFL - Packwood](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=53&ID=5905)
  * Keyed up several times, heard the repeater ID
  * no contact =/
* 146.78 [WW7CH - Pardise, Mt. Rainier](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=53&ID=11180)
  * KJ7OTM again (possible that repeater is linked to WB7DOB, didn't realize at the time)
* 147.06 [WA7UHD - Baw Faw Peak](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=53&ID=30)
  * N1BEC - early signal report from East of Randle: could be heard, but not well
  * No contact from just west of Morton, WA
  * KJ7ITE - finally made contact east of Mayfield Dam!
* 145.47 [K7CPR - Olympia, Capitol Peak](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=53&ID=358)
  * Heard from east of Morton
  * W7HBP gave excellent signal report, ~15mi east of I-5
