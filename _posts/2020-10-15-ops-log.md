Today we took a hike on Mirror Lake Trail, near Mt. Hood, Government Camp.
[[APRS Track]](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=14&ts=1602720000&te=1602806400&call=a%2FKF7HVM-5).

During this trip, I beaconed my position at 4 minute intervals while
walking for about 7 miles total, out and back. About 7 of
approximately 75 packets were gated to APRS-IS!
