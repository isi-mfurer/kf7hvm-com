# [`dzcb`](https://github.com/masenf/dzcb/tree/rewrite)

Pre-alpha DMR codeplug generator for TYT MD-UV380 and OpenGD77.

This probably wont go anywhere itself, but has inspired a web-based
codeplug editor focusing on importing and editing channel and zone data,
usability, sharing, and wide export compatibility.
